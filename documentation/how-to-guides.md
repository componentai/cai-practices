## What is a How-To Guide?

How-to guides are **task-oriented** documents that help users accomplish specific goals or solve particular problems. They provide practical, step-by-step instructions for users who already have a basic understanding of the subject.

- Focus on **achieving a specific goal**
- Assume the reader knows what they want to do
- Address real-world problems and tasks
- The user is in control, not the documentation

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Address Real-World Complexity

How-to guides tackle actual problems users might encounter. Unlike tutorials (which use safe, controlled examples), how-to guides deal with the messiness of real situations.

### 2. Provide a Set of Instructions

Offer a clear sequence of steps that lead to the desired outcome. Each step should be actionable.

### 3. Describe a Logical Sequence

Present steps in a coherent order that makes sense for achieving the goal.

### 4. Seek Flow

Maintain a smooth progression from one step to the next. The user should be able to follow along without getting stuck.

### 5. Pay Attention to Naming

Use clear and consistent terminology:
- Name guides after the task: "How to configure X", "How to integrate Y"
- Be specific about what the guide helps achieve

## How-To Guides vs Tutorials

| How-To Guides | Tutorials |
|---------------|-----------|
| Goal-oriented | Learning-oriented |
| User has a specific problem | Learner is acquiring skills |
| Assumes existing knowledge | Teaches from scratch |
| Addresses real-world complexity | Uses controlled examples |
| User is in charge | Teacher is in charge |

## Language of How-To Guides

- "This guide shows you how to..."
- "If you want to X, first do Y"
- "To achieve X, you need to..."
- Imperative mood: "Configure...", "Add...", "Run..."

# Note
How to guides MAY be written as Jupyter notebooks, scripts, or something third. Usually, a notebook will be the best choice.
