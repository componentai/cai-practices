## What is a Tutorial?

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** documents designed to guide learners through practical steps to acquire new skills. They provide a hands-on experience, allowing learners to achieve specific outcomes by following well-defined actions.

- Focus on **learning by doing**
- Guide beginners through a series of steps
- Aim to help the learner **acquire skills**, not just knowledge
- The learner is in the hands of the teacher

## Key Principles

### 1. Show the Learner Where They'll Be Going

Clearly outline the objectives and end goals of the tutorial to set expectations.

### 2. Deliver Visible Results Early and Often

Ensure each step produces a tangible result, reinforcing the learner's progress and maintaining motivation.

### 3. Maintain a Narrative of the Expected

Provide continuous feedback to confirm that the learner is on the right path. Tell them what they should see or experience.

### 4. Point Out What the Learner Should Notice

Highlight important observations to deepen understanding and help them recognize significant outcomes.

### 5. Target the Feeling of Doing

Focus on engaging the learner in active participation to foster skill acquisition. The experience of doing is what matters.

### 6. Encourage and Permit Repetition

Allow learners to repeat steps to build confidence and reinforce learning.

### 7. Ruthlessly Minimize Explanation

Keep explanations concise to maintain focus on practical actions. Explanation belongs elsewhere—link to it if needed.

### 8. Focus on the Concrete

Use specific, tangible examples to facilitate comprehension. Avoid abstractions.

### 9. Ignore Options and Alternatives

Stick to a single, clear path to avoid confusion. Don't present choices—make decisions for the learner.

### 10. Aspire to Perfect Reliability

Ensure that the tutorial works consistently for all learners. Test it thoroughly and keep it updated.
