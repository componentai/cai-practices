# Explanation Documentation

Summary of [Diátaxis Explanation Guide](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/)

## What is Explanation?

Explanation is **understanding-oriented** documentation that provides context, background, and theoretical insights. It deepens and broadens the reader's understanding of a subject through discursive discussion.

- Answers "Why?" and "Can you tell me about...?"
- Provides **context and background**
- Discusses the reasoning behind decisions
- Is reflective and discursive, not action-oriented

## Key Characteristics

### Discursive Treatment

Explanation explores topics in depth, considering various perspectives and providing comprehensive analysis. Unlike tutorials and how-to guides (which are action-oriented), explanation allows for reflection.

### Understanding Over Action

The goal is comprehension, not task completion. Explanation illuminates:
- Why things are the way they are
- Historical context and design decisions
- Connections between concepts
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered

### Background and Context

Explanation provides the historical, technical, or theoretical context that helps readers understand the reasons behind practices or decisions.

## Key Principles

### 1. Make Connections

Connect the subject to related topics and concepts. Show how things fit together in the bigger picture.

### 2. Provide Context

Give the background needed to understand not just what, but why. Discuss the circumstances that led to current approaches.

### 3. Discuss the Subject Matter

Allow for extended discussion. Unlike reference (which is terse), explanation can explore topics thoroughly.

### 4. Consider Alternatives

Discuss different perspectives, approaches that weren't taken, and why certain decisions were made over others.

### 5. Don't Instruct or Describe

Explanation should not include step-by-step instructions (that's how-to guides) or technical specifications (that's reference). Link to those instead.
